### What I learned

This challenge was a good chance for me to practice more on HTML & CSS techniques in my starting journey in learning frontend.
First, centering the card exactly in the middle of the screen was a funny thing to learn and here is my style code:
```css
.card {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%)
}
```
Secondly, box shadow property is a very beautiful thing to add some depth for the design:
```css
.card {
  box-shadow: 1px 1px 20px 0px hsl(220deg 15% 55% / 34%);
}
```

At the end I hope that challenge encourage me to move further in my journey ^_^.
